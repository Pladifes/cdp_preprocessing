# <a id="about"></a> About CDP preprocessing

## <a id="context"></a> Context

This project aims to propose <b>CDP preprocessed dataset</b> for researcher to foster their usage of the data. Cleaning is based on an open methodology shared here.

We are currently in discusion with [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en) to formalise how researchers will be able to acces these datasets through our [website](https://pladifes.institutlouisbachelier.org/), this beeing conditionned by them pre-purchasing the required data to CDP. 


## <a id="pladifes"></a> Pladifes

Pladifes is a research program aiming at easing the research in green and sustainable finance, as well as traditional one. They are the main authors of <b>CDP preprocessing</b>. Learn more about Pladifes [here](https://www.institutlouisbachelier.org/en/pladifes-a-large-financial-and-extra-financial-database-project-2/).

Databases produced in the context of Pladifes can be access [here (specialized ESG data)](https://pladifes.institutlouisbachelier.org/data/) and [here (financial and ESG indicators)](https://www.eurofidai.org/).

## <a id="installation"></a> Installation


You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
Git repository:

    https://github.com/Pladifes/corporate-ghg-emissions-estimations.git


## <a id="utilization"></a> Utilization

Code is intended to be easy as easy to use and understand as possible. 
To generate the preprocessed dataset, please directly exectute the main.py file. 
Prefilled parameters are designed for creating a concatenated dataset based on CDP files from years 2015 to 2022 (format : "CDP_CC_emissions data_year.xlsx").
